# sort_list
this program sorts a list of unordered numbers every time. it is probably not very efficient, but it works.

download the .py script and you can run it immediatly from the command line using 'python sort_list.py'

you can change the length of the list and or how many lists you want sorted on the bottom lines in the code.
